## Description

This Module 14 Challenge was to create an application that would allow a user to post about any tech topic onto a blog website after logging into a profile. They were also supposed to be able to comment on posts and edit/delete those posts and comments.

The reason for creating this challenge was to learn more about express, handlebars, using the sequelize package, and using models with handlebars and express.

I was unable to fully complete this project, in terms of adding functionality with the comments. However, I was able to get the rest of it completed, which I still consider a small success.
